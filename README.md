# Flight_Delay_Prediction

This project aims to predict flight arrival times, delivering actionable insights for passengers and airline companies alike. By forecasting delays with accuracy, we seek to enhance the travel experience—empowering customers to plan better—and boost operational efficiency for airlines through optimized scheduling and resource allocation. Our approach leverages big data analysis, examining key factors like weather conditions, airport traffic, and historical flight performance to uncover patterns and drive predictions.
